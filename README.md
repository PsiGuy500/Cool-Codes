# Machine Learning, calculators, and games
This repository contains calculator programs, elementary machine learning and data science programs, and some other fun ones. Most programs are written in Python. 

Note: Fantasymashf.py is an expansion of a game in Sololearn which I altered in order for the program to have more functionality.
