# Machine Learning Algorithms

This folder has several machine learning programs, including programs which include the K Neighbor's algorithm, K means clustering, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees. Note: Some of these programs (KNeighbors.py, KNeighbors(2).py, KMeans.py, KMeans(2).py) are originaly from the Python Machine Learning course from Coursera.
