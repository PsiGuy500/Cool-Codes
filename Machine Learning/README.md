# Machine Learning Algorithms

This folder has several machine learning programs, including programs which include the K Neighbor's algorithm, K means clustering, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees. 

Note: Some of these programs are originally from the Python Machine Learning course from Coursera and Sololearn placed here for personal practice and reference.
